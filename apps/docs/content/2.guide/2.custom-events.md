title: Custom Events
description: Send custom data to your WebSocket client with C# actions
---

## C# Methods
You can send custom events to your WebSocket client utilizing these C# methods in Streamer.bot:

::callout{icon=i-mdi-bookmark to=https://docs.streamer.bot/api/csharp/method/WebsocketBroadcastString target=_blank}
`CPH.WebsocketBroadcastString(string data)`{lang=cs}
::
::callout{icon=i-mdi-bookmark to=https://docs.streamer.bot/api/csharp/method/WebsocketBroadcastJson target=_blank}
`CPH.WebsocketBroadcastJson(string data)`{lang=cs}
::

## Handling Custom Events
Custom events are sent with event source `General` and event type of `Custom`.

You can easily [subscribe](/guide/events) to your custom events using the `.on()` method:

```ts [example.ts]
// Subscribe to all custom events from the connected Streamer.bot instance
await client.on('General.Custom', (data) => {
  console.log('Custom Event:', data);
});
```

## Example

We're going to utilize custom events to drive a media overlay from Streamer.bot.

Here we are using an `event` key within our JSON to allow us to easily filter our related events on the client side.

We are also going to define an `action` key in our JSON payload to request a specific action from the client.

```cs [example.csharp]
string json = "{'event': 'mediaPlayer', 'action': 'pause'}".Replace("'", "\"");
CPH.WebsocketBroadcastJson(json);
```

On the client side, we will handle these events with the following event handler:

```ts [example.ts]
await client.on('General.Custom', (payload) => {
  if (payload.data.event === 'mediaPlayer' && payload.data.action === 'pause') {
    // handle media player pause events in here :)
  }
});
```
