::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
Streamer.bot will not send any events to your client until a subscription has been requested.
::

## Handling Events with .on()

::callout{icon=i-mdi-check-circle}
This is the **recommended** method for easily subscribing to WebSocket events
::

Utilizing the `client.on()`{lang=ts} method will make your life easier by:
- Automatically handling event subscriptions for the requested events
- Utilizing `[source].[name]` event shorthand for registering new event listeners
- Allow you to easily handle event data for specific events or groups of events by defining inline event callbacks

### Examples
Subscribe to a specific event, with callback:
```ts
// Subscribe to Twitch ChatMessage events
client.on('Twitch.ChatMessage', (data) => {
  console.log('New Twitch Chat Message:', data);
});
```

You can subscribe to all events of a specific source with `"[sourceName].*"`
```ts
// Subscribe to all Twitch events
client.on('Twitch.*', (data) => {
  console.log('Twitch Event Received:' data);
});
```

If you want to subscribe to **all** event sources & events from Streamer.bot, simply pass `"*"`
```ts
client.on('*', (data) => {
  console.log('Event Received:', data);
});
```

::callout{icon=i-mdi-bookmark to=/api/events}
Explore the [Events API Reference](/api/events) to see all possible event sources and types
::

## Manually manage subscriptions
You can also manually define event subscriptions using the following methods.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-lightbulb color=amber}
These methods all support the legacy [Event Subscription Format](/api/events#event-subscription-type) which the Streamer.bot WebSocket API expects.
::

### On Connect

Define the events subscriptions you need when initializing your client.

You can subscribe to all events with `"*"` or pass a configuration object:

```ts
// Creating a new client and automatically subscribing to all events from Streamer.bot
const client = new StreamerbotClient({
  subscribe: '*'
});

// Creating a new client and automatically subscribing to specific events
const client = new StreamerbotClient({
  subscribe: {
    'Twitch': ['ChatMessage']
  }
});
```

### Subscribe Method

The `client.subscribe()` method interacts directly with the Streamer.bot WebSocket API.

You can subscribe to all events with `"*"` or pass a configuration object:

```ts
// Subscribe to all events from Streamer.bot
await client.subscribe('*');

// Subscribe to specific events
await client.subscribe({
  'Twitch': ['ChatMessage']
});
```

### Unsubscribe Method

Manually unsubscribe from any existing event subscriptions.

The `client.unsubscribe()` method accepts the same format as the [Subscribe](#subscribe-method).

```ts
// Unsubscribe to all events from Streamer.bot
await client.unsubscribe('*');

// Unsubscribe from specific events
await client.subscribe({
  'Twitch': ['ChatMessage']
});
```
