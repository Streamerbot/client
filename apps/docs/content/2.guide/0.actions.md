There are multiple requests that allow you to fetch various data from your Streamer.bot instance.

Explore the [Methods API Reference](/api/requests) which documents all requests and their responses.

## Fetching Actions

You can fetch a list of all actions on your Streamer.bot instance with the [getActions](/api/requests#getactions) method.

```ts [Request]
const response = await client.getActions();
```

```json [Response]
{
  "status": "ok",
  "id": "[request-id]",
  "actions" : [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "group": "None",
      "id": "a0ff6f91-a51e-4b7d-948b-5e03ff4a82f0",
      "name": "Action Number One",
      "subaction_count": 4
    },
    {
      "enabled": false,
      "group": "None",
      "id": "84a0dfe7-5033-4e14-964b-ce2dfe9f5e09",
      "name": "Action Number Two",
      "subaction_count": 18
    },
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

## Executing Actions

You can execute an action on your Streamer.bot instance with the [doAction](/api/requests#doaction) method.

The first parameter accepts the `actionId` which can be acquired from your Streamer.bot application, or programmatically using the [getActions](/api/requests#getactions) method outlined above.

```ts [Basic Example]
// Execute an action with actionId "9c6203fd-363f-4834-983e-b10423c568ea"
const response = await client.doAction("9c6203fd-363f-4834-983e-b10423c568ea");
 ```

You can pass in custom arguments as a JavaScript object in the second parameter.

```ts [Example with Arguments]
const response = await client.doAction(
  "9c6203fd-363f-4834-983e-b10423c568ea",
  {
    // Will be available as %myCustomArgument% inside your Streamer.bot action!
    "myCustomArgument": "Hello!",
    // Will be available as %anotherCustomArgument%
    "anotherCustomArgument": 200
  }
)
```

### Wait for a Custom Response
_Added in `@streamerbot/client v1.10.0`_

Sometimes you may want to mimic a traditional request/response style when calling your actions.

Streamer.bot Client provides helpers to do this by taking advantage of the [Custom Event Trigger](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/sub-actions/core/triggers/custom-event-trigger) sub-action.

Add this sub-action to the end of your action in Streamer.bot:

![Custom Event Trigger Dialog](/img/screenshots/custom-event-trigger.png)

To wait for a response, simply set the `customEventResponse` option to `true`{lang=cs}

```ts [Request]
const response = await client.doAction(
  "9c6203fd-363f-4834-983e-b10423c568ea", // action id
  { "foo": "bar" }, // args
  { customEventResponse: true } // options
);

```

The response object will now contain `customEventResponseArgs`{lang=cs}, populated with the full set of args from the end of your action, including any new args you may have populated with other sub-actions.

```json [Response]
{
  "id": "sb:client:req:1748460327205-3167168341",
  "status": "ok",
  "customEventResponseArgs": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "test": "Some new argument",
  }
}
```

The same technique can be used with the [executeCodeTrigger()](/api/requests#executecodetrigger) method as well!
